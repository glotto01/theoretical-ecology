#Functions used for two patch interaction#<br />
*twopatchinit* creates the initial density for spacing w<br /><br />
*twopatchrun* runs over the w range, determing when the fixed point condition is met. It writes to a csv what the population was at the stopping time , and what the stopping time was.<br /><br />
*twopatchplot* plots the population time series and final density curve<br /><br />
*uequpatch.mat* is .mat data file containing the unimodal equilibrium density curve
